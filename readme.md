[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/fa79c0192b04483d94d63c1e3afed5aa)](https://www.codacy.com/manual/tmcbrigido/s-p500?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=tmcbrigido/s-p500&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

This project aims to explore the pandas' library to explore financial data and the matplotlib library to visualize that data. I will use the S&P500 prices for the period 1995-2019 to look at the cumulative returns, simple and exponential moving averages and compare the cumulative returns with the inflation. You can read the full analysis [here](https://tmcbrigido.netlify.com/projects/) and please feel free to reach out to me.
